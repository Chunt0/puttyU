Python Basics: Essential for any PyTorch project.

PyTorch Installation: Install the framework and understand CUDA compatibility if using GPUs.

Tensor Operations: Master basics like creation, slicing, and manipulation.

Autograd: PyTorch's automatic differentiation library.

Simple Neural Network: Build a basic feed-forward network using nn.Module.

Loss Functions: Understand nn.CrossEntropyLoss, nn.MSELoss, etc.

Optimizers: Familiarize yourself with torch.optim, like SGD and Adam.

Forward and Backward Pass: Implement training loops.

Data Loading: Use DataLoader and Dataset for batch processing.

Model Evaluation: Implement validation loops, understand metrics like accuracy, F1-score.

Model Saving & Loading: Use torch.save and torch.load for checkpoints.

CPU vs GPU: Learn how to move tensors and models between CPU and GPU.

Fine-tuning: Adapt pretrained models to new tasks.

Regularization: Understand techniques like dropout and weight decay.

Batch Normalization: Stabilizes and potentially speeds up training.

Transfer Learning: Use models like ResNet, VGG from torchvision.models.

Custom Layers: Create user-defined layers extending nn.Module.

RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs: Implement sequence models.

Attention Mechanisms: Understand the basics, relevant for transformers.

Distributed Training: Learn basics of torch.nn.DataParallel and torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.
