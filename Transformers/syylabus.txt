The course will consist of lectures, homework assignments, quizzes, and two hands-on implementation weeks. There will be a final project where students can either conduct research or build an application using transformer models.

Each topic will be accompanied by practical exercises and code labs to consolidate the theoretical understanding into real-world applicability.
